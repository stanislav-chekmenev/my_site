I'm **Stanislav Chekmenev**, a machine learning specialist & educator. My professional path led me through particle physics research to cutting-edge ML applications, with a current focus on symmetry-aware models and generative ML for protein design. I hold a **PhD in Physics** from RWTH Aachen University, where I specialized in spin dynamics simulations of subatomic particles. With this solid background in math and physics, I smoothly transitioned to machine learning after my defense.

## Professional Evolution

Over the past eight years, I've evolved from traditional data science roles into advanced ML positions, consistently studying the latest techniques and implementing them at work.

## Current Focus

I'm currently focused on **geometric deep learning and protein design**, which I began exploring in 2023. At the end of 2024, I took a break from full-time work to concentrate on the self-initiated educational research project in protein generation. I've successfully studied and modified one of the recent SOTA models in the field, FoldFlow-2. 

## Philosophy & Approach

Apart from my technical interests, I share a deep appreciation for Eastern philosophy and spirituality. After spending almost a year at a Buddhist monastery in 2023, I developed a new perspective on patience, kindness and the value of sustained focus. I learned how to translate these qualities not only into my day-to-day life, but especially into my profession. Combining this experience with my physics background, I now tackle problems both patiently and foundationally, by searching for an effective solution rather than a quick fix. 

Additionally, I've guided numerous students and colleagues through complex ML projects, always emphasizing clear understanding of the core principles and the importance of possible ethical implications.
